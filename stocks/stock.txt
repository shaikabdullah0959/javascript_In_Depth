Mutual fund/Stock Market

Invest in Equity mutual funds 

Plan - Direct vs regular -> Direct has higher returns

Direct plans offer higher returns due to a lower expense ratio than regular funds. You get the benefit from the exclusion of distributor commissions, which leads to higher returns. Unlike direct plans, regular plans have a higher expense ratio, which eats out your return and offers slightly lower returns.


Option Growth vs IDCW Reinvest vs IDCW Payout
                                IDCW: Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (previously called Dividend)

Which is better Mutual Fund ->  growth or IDCW reinvestment?


Growth Plan

Usually higher than the IDCW plan as it focuses on long-term wealth creation. Dividend income is taxable as per the individual's income tax slab rate. Short-term capital gains or long-term capital gains are applicable depending on the holding period of investment.

How to pick a stock - screener.in
1.  Company should be from Market leaders
2. Good free cash flow
3. ROE - return on Equity should be minimum 15%
4. Then check fundamental analysis, evaluation  and technical analysis


Equity represents ownership in a company.
Owner’s equity means owner’s ownership.
Owner’s equity is also known as Net Equity
 Net Equity = Total assets - borrowings

Stock/Share 

Primary Market/Secondary Market

The primary market in the share market is where new securities/shares are created and sold for the first time. It is also known as the new issue market. 
Initial Public Offering (IPO): The most common form of a primary market transaction. When a company decides to go public and offer its shares to the public for the first time, it conducts an IPO. Investors buy these new shares directly from the company and fund goes to the company

The secondary market is where previously issued securities such as stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments are bought and sold among investors. Unlike the primary market, where securities/shares are sold directly by the issuer(Business/company), the secondary market involves transactions between investors


Issuer -> PM -> SM   ->    Investor
                                    <-
All the funds from PM goes to company and the shares issued by the  issuer(company ) are listed on SM. Then buy and sell of shares occur in SM(NSE/BSE) between investors.

Shares should be bought  based on intrinsic value not on market value

Ways to find intrinsic value
1. Comparison with other companies
2. Discounted cash flow model

FV - Face value

Initial price of the share set by the promoter(company owner)

EPS - Earning per share

Company having 4 partners earned 100 rs in a year. Each partner’s profit is 25 rs. Here 25 is EPS…

EPS  = Net profit/ no of shares


P/E = price of the share/EPS 


        Lower PE -> Lower is the stock price,  Lower PE -> might be bcoz of slow growth or -ve growth or future prospects are not great
       Higher PE -> Higher is the stock price,  Higher PE ->  might be bcoz of high growth or greater future prospects

P/E  has to be compared with peers or industry avg…

Indiainfoonline.com for peer comparison 

Market cap -> No of shares * price of one share
Enterprise value  -> Actual value of the company (Lesson 3)
Standalone  P&L(Profit and loss) -> Company’s earning by its business
Consolidated P&L(Profit and loss) -> Company’s earning by its business and  the revenue earned by investing in other companies.

P/B -> price of share/book value

Book Value ->  if the shop is owned by two partners and they sell the shop for 100rs then each will get 50rs. Here 50rs is the book value per share…

Book Value  =  price of the company while selling total no of shares.
 *** While picking stocks P/B should be considered for companies who have assets like Tata steel( e.g -> machineries)  and should not be considered for companies like IT bcoz they don’t have assets

Dividend Yield  -> part of the profit earned in a year by the company will be shared to the share holders. That amount is Dividend yield.
                                 If Dividend yield is high then company is low growth company and share value of the company will not increase much

Promoter Holding -> percentage of the shares owned the owner/s of the company. PH should be > 30% atleast
                                      If PH > 30% then pledge % should be less. This is important point.
    				       if pledge % is high -> this indicates promoter/owner has taken loan by giving the share % to the person who has given loan. Once the loan is returned shares will be owned  				       by the owner again. (Shares ko girvi rakha hain by taking loan by the owner…)
LESSON 4

PAT Margin/Net Margin ->
Profit After Tax(PAT)

Example -> cost of pen = 10rs
                     Selling price of pen =. 20rs
                     Profit = 10rs
                     Expenses for selling pen = 5rs
                     Net profit =. profit -  expenses = 10 - 5 = 5rs
PAT margin (always calculated on selling price) = 5/20 * 100 = 25%
PAT Margin/Net Margin is real profit

ROE ( Return on Equity) -> Money earned by company based on share holder’s money

ROE =  Net profit/share holders equity * 100.  (Equity means money)


            Net profit = 100rs
	    share holders equity = 500rs
             ROE = 100/500 * 100  = 20 %
ROE should be good 

Debt Equity should be almost Zero 

ROE should be good even if PAT Margin is less and Debt Equity is almost 0

IF ROE is good when debt equity is more then the stock might not be good…

ROE > 20% is considered good

Turn over is total sales/Top line
Profit after tax - bottom line


       Share split:                    Bonus share
1. FV decreases              No change in FV
2. No Profit sharing.       Reserve of profits is shared
3. 1: 5                               1: 5
       Each share is              For every 5 shares we will get 1 extra share
       Split into 5 shares

Upper circuit/Lower Circuit - SEBI sets upper circuit or lower circuit for companies. It can be 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%,40%
For example -> A stock price can increase maximum by 20% or fall by max 20% in a single day based on the Last traded price of previous day

NSE has shares, future & options(derivatives), debentures - Many companies provides all of these or few of these. 

A company who provides future & options can increase/fall by more than 20%

BSE- SENSEX INDEX     			NSE - NIFTY INDEX

SENSEX INDEX,  NIFTY INDEX are representatives of  stock market performance   

 NIFTY INDEX is based on top 50 companies 
SENSEX INDEX is based on top 30 companies 

In 2001 a base value was set as 100 for market capitalisation 
For example company A share price is 500 and no of share holders is 1000 then  market capitalisation  is 500 * 1000 = 5 Lakh
Now we say Sensex is represented as 100 for 5 lakh
If company A share price increases the MC market capitalisation increases hence Sensex base value also increases 


* Promoter selling shares can be bcoz of two reasons 1. He needs money 2. Want to comply with SEBI. SEBI rule is promoter can have max 75% of the shares.
* Promoter selling shares is a -ve sign if he needs money

Pledging
Pledging of shares is a -ve sign. Pledging means share ko girvi rakhna

Book Value/Worth - original value
E.g, suppose a house is built at a price of 1 cr and  now if owner is selling at 2cr
Then 1 cr is book value and current price is 2cr
In share market terms 2cr is current share price and actual share price is 1 cr also known as book value

FV - Face value

Initial price of the share set by the promoter(company owner)

EPS - Earning per share

Company having 4 partners earned 100 rs in a year. Each partner’s profit is 25 rs. Here 25 is EPS…

EPS  = Net profit/ no of shares


P/E = price of the share/EPS  (8:35 minutes in 15 hour video of sagar dodeja)

Dividend Yield  -> part of the profit earned in a year by the company will be shared to the share holders. That amount is Dividend yield.
                                 If Dividend yield is high then company is low growth company and share value of the company will not increase much

ROCE - Return on capital employed /capital invested by the management of the company

             ROCE > 30% -> Great company
15% < ROCE < 30%  -> good company
             ROCE < 15% -> no Trade

ROE - Return on Equity

Return on the share holders equity/money
ROE will be good if ROCE is good i.e, if company performs then only return will be good
ROE > 20% is considered good

Debt to Equity 
( Debt means loan amount)  and equity - is amount of all share holders + amount of company reserves

D/E should always be less.


            D/E  < 15% -> Great company
15% < D/E  < 50%  -> good company
             D/E  > 50% -> no Trade


  ROCE > 30% AND   D/E  < 15%

Steps to be taken care while using BB strategy

1. Bottom green line in Bollinger band is buying line. Red candle should go below green line and the next day there should be green candle which has to be increased by same or more percentage than the red candle fall percentage. Then on 3rd day buy the stock with a price near to previous closing day price (buying price should not exceed 1.5%  higher than previous closing price). Then wait for10% increase in price or sell it within 10 days.
Also, After buying the stock if the price falls by 4% the sell it by adding stop loss of 4%
2.  Add relative strength index indicator with settings
