## Pass By Value and Pass By Reference in JavaScript

### Pass By Value: (Applies to Primitive Data Types)

Primitive data types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `BigInt`, `Symbol`) are **immutable** and stored directly in memory. When assigned to another variable, only the **value** is copied, not the reference.

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = a;
b = 10;

console.log(a); // Output: 5
console.log(b); // Output: 10
```

üìå **Key Concept:**
- Changes made to `b` do not affect `a` since they hold independent copies.

---

### Pass By Reference: (Applies to Non-Primitive Data Types)

Objects, arrays, and functions are stored **by reference** in memory. Assigning them to another variable does **not create a copy**; instead, it passes the **reference** to the same memory location.

```javascript
let obj1 = { name: "Abdullah" };
let obj2 = obj1;

obj2.name = "Shaik";

console.log(obj1); // Output: { name: "Shaik" }
console.log(obj2); // Output: { name: "Shaik" }
```

üìå **Key Concept:**
- Since `obj1` and `obj2` share the same reference, modifying `obj2` also modifies `obj1`.

---

## Cloning Objects to Avoid Reference Issues

If we want to create a copy of an object **without affecting the original**, we must **clone** it.

### ‚úÖ Shallow Cloning
Shallow cloning works for **single-level objects**, but nested objects are still passed by reference.

**Solution 1: Using `Object.assign()`**
```javascript
let clonedObj = Object.assign({}, obj1);  // Creates a new object with copied properties
```

**Solution 2: Using Spread Operator (`...`)**
```javascript
let clonedObj = { ...obj1 }; // Creates a new object with copied properties
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation:**
- These methods **do not deep copy** nested objects.

---

### üîç The Problem with Shallow Cloning

```javascript
let obj = {
    a: 'a',
    b: 'b',
    c: { deep: 'try and copy' },
};

// Shallow clones
let clone1 = Object.assign({}, obj);
let clone2 = { ...obj };

// Modify the nested object
obj.c.deep = 'hahaha';

console.log(clone1.c.deep); // Output: "hahaha" (unexpected)
console.log(clone2.c.deep); // Output: "hahaha" (unexpected)
```

üìå **Key Issue:**
- The nested object (`c`) is still referenced, meaning changes in `obj` affect both `clone1` and `clone2`.

---

### ‚úÖ Deep Cloning (Solving Nested Object Reference Issue)
To **fully copy nested objects**, we need **deep cloning**.

#### **Solution 1: Using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))`**
```javascript
let deepClone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
```

‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Simple and effective for deeply nested objects.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons:**
- **Loses methods & special types** (e.g., `Date`, `RegExp`, `Map`, `Set`).

---

#### **Solution 2: Using a Recursive Deep Freeze Function**
If the object has methods or special types, we can manually deep freeze it.

```javascript
function deepFreeze(obj) {
    Object.keys(obj).forEach(key => {
        if (typeof obj[key] === "object" && obj[key] !== null) {
            deepFreeze(obj[key]);
        }
    });
    return Object.freeze(obj);
}

const deepUser = {
    name: "Charlie",
    details: { age: 40, city: "Los Angeles" }
};

deepFreeze(deepUser);
deepUser.details.age = 45; // No effect
console.log(deepUser.details.age); // Output: 40
```

‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Ensures immutability even for nested objects.
- Works well for state management (e.g., Redux).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons:**
- Still doesn't preserve methods, dates, or complex objects.

## Summary
| Concept                | Behavior |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Pass by Value**      | Copies the actual value (primitives: `string`, `number`, etc.) |
| **Pass by Reference**  | Copies the reference, not the value (objects, arrays) |
| **Shallow Copy**       | Only copies top-level properties (nested objects are still references) |
| **Deep Copy**          | Fully copies all properties, including nested objects |
| **Best Deep Clone Method** | `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` (for simple objects) or recursive deep clone for complex objects |

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
- Use **shallow cloning** (`{ ...obj }` or `Object.assign()`) when nested properties don‚Äôt need to change.
- Use **deep cloning** (`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))`) when full object independence is required.
- Use **deep freeze** when immutability is necessary.

By understanding pass by value vs. pass by reference, and how to properly clone objects, you can prevent unintended side effects and write more predictable JavaScript code. üöÄ
