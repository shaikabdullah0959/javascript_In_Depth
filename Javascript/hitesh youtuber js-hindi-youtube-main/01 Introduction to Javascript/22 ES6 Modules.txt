JavaScript modules are a way to structure and organize code into separate files, allowing you to export and import functionality across different files.
They help in making the code more modular, reusable, and maintainable.

Key Concepts
    Export: This allows you to make variables, functions, or classes available for use in other modules.
    Import: This allows you to use functionality from other modules in your current module.

Types of Exports
    Named Exports: Multiple items can be exported from a module with their specific names.
    Default Export: A single item is exported as the main export of the module.

    // file.js
    export const name = "John";
    export function greet() {
        console.log("Hello");
    }

    export default function greeting() {
     console.log("Hello");
    }


   // app.js
  import greeting, { name, greet } from './file.js';
