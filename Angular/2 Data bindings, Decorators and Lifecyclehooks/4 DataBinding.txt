What is Data Binding? communication b/w component and html

Types of Data Binding: one way data binding and two way data binding
one way data binding - component to view(html) or view(html) to component
Two-Way Binding: Binding both a property and an event to a class property.


communication between component and html happens through binding
      1. one way binding  
          string interpolation {{}}, property binding  component -> html
          event binding    html -> component
      2. two way binding   c-> html and htlm -> c
      3. one difference between interpolation and property binding is when a non string value(i.e, boolean true or false) is
      assigned to attribute of html interpolation doesn't make a difference for both true or false where as p binding does.
      e.g [disabled] ='true/false' disables/enables input fields
          disabled='{{true/false}}' disables in both cases.
      4. in case of binding a value to a string interpolation is used.
         e.g <img src="images/{{imageName}}"  imageName is a variable in Component file.
      5. to pass a value through event binding use $event. e.g (keyup) ="sendData($event)". To access the value in class
      use event.target.value.
      6. For two way binding ngModel is required and to be able to use it FormsModule is required. so import it in app.module.ts file.
      <input [(ngModel)]="name">
      7. property and event Binding can be used on custom properties and methods and inbuilt attributes.
      custom property and event Binding - [fName]="firstName", (setLName)="setLastName()" 
      inbuilt property and event Binding - [disabled]="true" (click)="xyz()"
