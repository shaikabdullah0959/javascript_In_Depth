What are Template-driven Forms?

In Template-driven forms You design the form in the HTML template using directives.
structure of the form, validation of the fields and format of the fields are taken care in html itself.

Why do we need it?

Simplicity: It is simple and easy to use for basic forms.
Declarative: The form logic is declared in the template.

<form #f=ngForm>
<input type="text" name="firstName" ngModel> // name is mandatory while using ngModel in TDF.
                                                ngModel looks for name attribute and add it to 
                                                the global ngForm object
</form>

{{ f.value | json }} - displays the values of the form
