What is the HttpClient Module?

The HttpClient Module in Angular is like a courier service that allows you to send and receive data over HTTP.

Why do we need it?

Communication: It allows your app to communicate with back-end services.
Asynchronous: It handles asynchronous data fetching and posting.

import { HttpClientModule, HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

    @NgModule({
    imports: [HttpClientModule],
    })
    export class AppModule { }

    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({
    selector: 'app-my-component',
    template: '<div>{{data | json}}</div>'
    })
    export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
    data: any;

    constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

    ngOnInit() {
        this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data')
        .subscribe(response => {
            this.data = response;
        });
    }
    }
Observable is a HTTP response that arrives asynchronously.
