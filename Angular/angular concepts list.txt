Angular

1. Understand Core Angular Concepts:

Architecture:
Modules: NgModule, declarations, imports, providers, bootstrapping.
Components: Component lifecycle, decorators, data binding (interpolation, property, event, and two-way binding).
Services and Dependency Injection: Creating services, injecting services into components and other services.

Templates:
Directives: Structural (*ngIf, *ngFor) and attribute directives (ngClass, ngStyle).
Pipes: Built-in pipes (DatePipe, UpperCasePipe, etc.), creating custom pipes.
Template Syntax: Template reference variables, input/output properties, event binding.

Routing:
Router Module: Configuring routes, router outlets, navigation.
Route Guards: CanActivate, CanDeactivate, Resolve, etc.
Lazy Loading: Implementing lazy-loaded modules.

Forms:
Template-driven Forms: ngModel, form directives.
Reactive Forms: FormControl, FormGroup, FormBuilder, validation.
HTTP Client:
HttpClient Module: Making HTTP requests, handling responses, error handling, interceptors.

State Management:
Component State Management: Input/output properties, local component state.
Global State Management: Services, NgRx (if applicable).

Advanced Topics:
Change Detection: Zones, ChangeDetectorRef, OnPush strategy.
Angular Universal: Server-side rendering.
Performance Optimization: Lazy loading, AOT compilation, optimization techniques.
